# Random_Password_Generator

🔐 Secure Password Generator

A Java-based console application for generating strong, random, and secure passwords.
This tool allows users to generate multiple passwords at once with customizable lengths, ensuring better security for online accounts, applications, and confidential systems.

📌 Features

-> Generate cryptographically strong random passwords.

-> Support for custom password length (minimum recommended: 12 characters).

-> Generate multiple passwords in one go.


Passwords include:

1. Uppercase letters

2. Lowercase letters

3. Digits

4. Special characters (!@#$%^&*()-_=+[]{}|;:',.<>?/~`)


🛠 Technologies Used

1. Java (Core Java concepts)

2. Random class for generating randomness

3. Scanner class for user input handling


🚀 How It Works

-> The program prompts the user for the desired password length (must be at least 12 characters).

-> The user specifies the number of passwords to generate.

-> Random passwords are generated from a defined set of characters.

-> All generated passwords are displayed on the console.


🔒 Security Note

This project is for educational purposes. For real-world applications requiring high security, consider using SecureRandom instead of Random to ensure cryptographic strength.
